abstract: We present a flexible chamber to measure the CO2 efflux from tree bark. The easy-to-use chamber is made of stainless steel and is clamped around an individual tree stem section; it uses a portable gas analyzer to retrieve the stem respiration value. Using the individual data points in combination with data from a forest inventory, the data can, in principle, be up-scaled to achieve the stand-scale stem respiration. We performed a feasibility study in a young forest plantation in tropical southern Taiwan, which yielded robust and meaningful results.
